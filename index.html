        <h4>Web Developer</h4>
        <p>I was born in Baku, Azerbaijan. Went to school in Baku. I always try to learn new skills and
            educate myself as much as possible. I have been trying to learn coding lately. This website 
            will show how much I have learned over one week of intensive training.
